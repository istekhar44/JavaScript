## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/istekhar44/JavaScript.git)
   cd javascript-learning
   ```

2. **Navigate to any topic folder:**
   ```bash
   cd API  # or any other folder
   ```

3. **Open files in your preferred editor and run in browser or Node.js**

## 📖 Learning Path Recommendation

### Beginner Level
1. **Variable** - Start with data types and variable declarations
2. **Operators** - Learn different types of operators
3. **Function** - Understand function basics
4. **loops** - Master iteration and control flow

### Intermediate Level
5. **Array** - Explore array methods and operations
6. **DOM** → **DOM2** → **DOM3** - Progress through DOM manipulation
7. **Events** - Learn event handling and user interactions
8. **oops** - Object-oriented programming concepts

### Advanced Level
9. **Promise** - Asynchronous programming foundations
10. **Async-Wait** - Modern async programming
11. **API** - Working with external data sources
12. **Tic_Tack_Toe** - Apply concepts in a real project

## 🛠️ What You'll Learn
